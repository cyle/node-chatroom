# Chatroom

La la la...

## Install

Make sure ya got node, make sure ya got npm.

Clone this repo. Go into it with Terminal.

Then: `npm install` to get the dependencies.

Then: `node chatroom.js` to run the chatroom.

That's it. Go to your browser as specified and check it out!

## Usage

Change your name if you want, or don't. There's no security/authentication.

## Notes

This purposefully doesn't keep any storage of messages anywhere.

Also, the client only ever keeps the last 200 messages.

The [font I used](https://managore.itch.io/m5x7) is pretty awesome.
